# mjpeg_view

Provide a viewer to play motion jpeg as a Flutter widget.

## Usage

```dart
MjpegView(
  uri: 'http://192.168.0.1:8000/video.mjpg',
)
```

There is a repository that compiles links to publicly available motion jpegs.
These sources are good to try as well.(Be careful not to overload them.)
